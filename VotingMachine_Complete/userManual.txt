The following files are included in the submitted Zip file, in addition to this userManualtxt document:



- Ballot.java class provides methods and attributes that allow for the construction of new Ballot objects.

 This class also keeps track of the number of votes placed for each candidate object constructed.

- ResultWriter.java class contains one method that formats the results of the election conducted using the voting machine GUI and prints these formatted results to a .txt file.

- BallotReader.java class contains one static method that reads the input from a text file representing the ballot information in a specified text format, extracts the information of interest, and uses that information to construct a new Ballot object.

- BallotTester.java class is an extension of TestCase class from junit framework that tests the constructor and the methods from the Ballot class.

- votingMachine_sampleInput.txt provides an example of a properly formatted input file

- README_ExtraCredit.txt provides an extensive explanation of the extra credit feature implemented in this project.

- ResultWriter_TestPlan.txt provides an extensive description of how the ResultWriter class should be properly tested.
