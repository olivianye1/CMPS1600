Project 1: Financial Literacy

This project, coded in C, demonstrates the importance of financial literacy in long term wealth. This project runs 40-year wealth simulations, using core functions debt, house, rent, and savingsPlacement, as well as other functions,  for persons created in a struct. User-friendly interface in main function allows for the execution of simulations for a variety of persons(2 hard-coded, 4 from input files, and unlimited from user input). All simulations output wealth arrays to text files.
